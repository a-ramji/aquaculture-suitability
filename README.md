# Aquaculture Suitability


## Overview
This project revolves around analyzing bathymetry, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Environmental Economic Zone (EEZ) data to find suitable locations for Oyster aquaculture. I ultimately develop an aquaculture suitability funciton which, given input parameters of ideal depth and temperature ranges for a specified species, outputs two maps displaying the total area and percentage area suitable for aquaculture of that species in EEZs along the West Coast of the United States. 



## Data

I use three primary datasets in this project:

### Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Data


### Bathymetry Data


### Environmental Economic Zone (EEZ) Data
